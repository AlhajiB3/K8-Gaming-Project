K8-Gaming-Project

This project demonstrates how to build a Prince of Persia game environment using AWS EKS Fargate and containers. Inspired by the tutorial on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/aws-builders/create-an-aws-eks-fargate-v130-and-play-prince-of-persia--a40), this repository contains all the necessary configurations, scripts, and resources for setting up and running the game in a cloud-native Kubernetes environment.

üìú Project Overview

The K8-Gaming-Project aims to deploy a containerized version of the Prince of Persia game in an AWS EKS Fargate environment. This setup leverages the serverless nature of Fargate, allowing for automatic scaling and seamless deployment of the game with minimal management. The game environment is set up in a Kubernetes cluster with containers running the game logic, assets, and web interfaces.

This repository is based on the detailed guide available on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/aws-builders/create-an-aws-eks-fargate-v130-and-play-prince-of-persia--a40): Create an AWS EKS Fargate V1.30 and play Prince of Persia, which outlines the process of setting up the infrastructure and deploying the game on AWS using Kubernetes and Fargate.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack 

AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Kubernetes service for managing containerized applications.
